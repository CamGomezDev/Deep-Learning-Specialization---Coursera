# Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization
This is a collection of all the notebooks from Coursera's five course specialization.

The name of the assignmnets have been changed a bit in order to help me identify more rapidly the relevant technologies being used. The [Wn] stands for the week corresponding to the assignment.
